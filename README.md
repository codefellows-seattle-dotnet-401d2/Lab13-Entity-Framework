# Mead High School Branded Student Roster & Enrollment System

## About:
This system is designed to help school faculty at your school track their students.

## Instructionals:
Simply load the program on a local or remote file server, have your IT or Networking professional handle the required port forwarding and domain name, and visit the page to see a list of students.
To add a new student to the list click "Enroll" at the top of the page.
Data saved on each student includes their home class, ( if that's a thing I have no idea anymore ) name and contact phone number.
After filling out the required fields and selecting a home class, click Submit to add the new student to the database.

Coming soon! Delete students, edit students! Stay tuned!
